I want housing preprocessed csv
ChatGPT said:
To preprocess your Housing.csv file, I'll perform typical data preprocessing steps, such as:

Loading the dataset

Handling missing values

Encoding categorical variables

Removing duplicates (if any)

Normalizing or standardizing numerical features (optional based on task)

Saving the cleaned data to a new CSV

Let's start by inspecting the file first.

The dataset has 545 entries and 13 columns. Here's a summary of the structure:

Numeric Columns: price, area, bedrooms, bathrooms, stories, parking

Categorical Columns: mainroad, guestroom, basement, hotwaterheating, airconditioning, prefarea, furnishingstatus

No missing values are present.

Next, I'll:

Encode categorical columns (yes/no to 1/0 and one-hot encode furnishingstatus)

Remove duplicates

Save the preprocessed data

Proceeding with that now. 

The preprocessed CSV file is ready: Download Housing_preprocessed.csv

Let me know if you want additional transformations like feature scaling or splitting the data for modeling.

It seems like I can’t do more advanced data analysis right now. Please try again later.

However, I can give you the full code here so you can copy it into a .py file (e.g., regression_model.py) and upload it to your GitHub repo:

## 📌 How to Run

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib

# 2. Run the model script
python regression_model.py
📊 Evaluation Metrics
MAE (Mean Absolute Error): Measures average magnitude of errors.

MSE (Mean Squared Error): Penalizes larger errors more than MAE.

R² Score: Represents proportion of variance explained by the model.

📖 Interview Questions & Answers
1. What assumptions does linear regression make?
Linearity

Independence of errors

Homoscedasticity (constant variance of errors)

Normality of residuals

No multicollinearity

2. How do you interpret the coefficients?
Each coefficient represents the expected change in the target variable for a one-unit increase in the corresponding feature, holding all other features constant.

3. What is R² score and its significance?
R² (coefficient of determination) tells how well the model explains the variance in the target. Closer to 1 means better fit.

4. When would you prefer MSE over MAE?
MSE is preferred when larger errors should be penalized more heavily than smaller ones.

5. How do you detect multicollinearity?
Using Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) or examining correlation matrices.

6. Difference between simple and multiple regression?
Simple regression uses one feature.

Multiple regression uses two or more features.

7. Can linear regression be used for classification?
No, linear regression is for regression tasks. For classification, use logistic regression or other classifiers.

8. What happens if you violate regression assumptions?
Violating assumptions can lead to biased or inefficient estimates, incorrect inferences, and poor model performance.
